# Students performance prediction

![students](students.png)

The objective of this project is to build a linear regression model that allows the prediction and evaluation of a student's final grade performance based on several characteristics.

The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) used is composed of 395 students from two different Portuguese schools, 
of which 33 different variables have been recorded for each one: the 33rd variable is the final grade in high school, i.e. the variable to be predicted.

The project was developed entirely in the R language with detailed comments in the [code](student_performance.R).
